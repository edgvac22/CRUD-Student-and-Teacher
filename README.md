# CRUD using Visual Basic & Sql Server.
Hello, I'm Edgardo Vaca, this is a crud using visual basic. Below I will give you the instructions so that the program works correctly for you:

- You need to have Visual Studio 2019 and Sql Server Managament Studio 2018.
- Fork all the files of (CRUD-Student-and-Teacher-Visual-Basic-) and put it in a folder.
- Import the database in your Sql Server.
- Open the proyect in Visual Studio 2019.
- Change the configurations in "Capa_Datos" BD.vb for your Sql configurations in line 11, where is the connectionstring.

Also, is important when you login in your Sql Server, join with SQL Server Authentication and not with Windows Authentication.
